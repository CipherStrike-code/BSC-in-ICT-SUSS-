## 1. Computer Technology
The topic helps to understand the basics of computer technology. Cover areas such as architecture, hardware components and functions, and the range of computer system classes. 

## 2. Data Representation and Processing
The topic focuses on the different numbering system used in the present computer technology. This includes the binary, decimal and hexadecimal numbering systems. It is expected to know how to convert between the three number systems, why there are different number system and how they are applied in computer systems. At a higher level, it is expected to know what data processing and rapid web-based database development are especially nowadays when information has become crucial to every organization.

# 3. Programming Languages
This topic focuses on how the high and low level languages work to connect the computer hardware components. We will have to learn the 68K Assembly Language and develop simple Assembly Language to control the hardware. 

# 4. Processor Technology
This topic covers the functions of the CPU. Student need to learn the Von Neumann architecture and how it may affect the future and not last forever. Some of the factors are the system bus, the main memory, caches and the processor technology.

# 5. Storage Technology
This topic focus on the memory hierarchy. It is importatn as it gives a sense of proportion for the vvarious memory devices in terms of access times and storage capacities. The pyramidal structure of the memory hierarchy provides a guide to students especially on the choice of a suitable memory storage device. Another topic that will be covered is the backup storage strategy.

# 6. Input/Output Technology and System Performance
This topic covers on the input and output devices that allow the computer too carry out the myriad tasks. It also examine on how system performance can be improved by processing parallelism and compression.
