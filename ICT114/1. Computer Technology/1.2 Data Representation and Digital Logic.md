## Objectives:
- Convert a number from one number system to another
- Represent integer in binary using unsigned magnitude, sign-magnitude and two's complement
- Represent real numbers in binary
- Perform simple arithmetic operations using various binary representations
- Perform logic operation using binary numbers.

## Computer Data
Data are represented in binary digits/bits (0 and 1). Basic data types are:
- Integer
- Real Number
- Character

# Conversion
We will now learn to convert from one number system to another. This is because humans typically understand number in decimal form (Base 10) which computers operate in binary form (Base 2). Octal (Base 8) and Hexadecimal (Base 16) make binary easier to read.

## Binary (Base 2) to Decimal (Base 10)
**Steps:**
1. Write down the positions numbers for each binary digit. Always remember to start counting from right most with the first starting from 0.
2. Multiply the respective binary digit with the $2^{(Position Number)}$.
3. Add up all the results together.

**Example:** <br>
10110 = 1* $2^{4}$ + 0 * $2^{3}$ + 1 * $2^{2}$ + 1 * $2^{1}$ + 0 * $2^{0}$ <br>
10110 = 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0 <br>
10110 = 22

## Decimal (Base 10) to Hexadecimal (Base 16)
**Steps:**
1. Divide by number 16 and obtain the remainder. Write down the remainder. If the remainder is between 10-15, use A - F.
2. Repeat step 1 but using the quotient from step 1. If the dividend is smaller than the divisor, the dividend will be the next remainder.
3. Read the remainders from bottom up.

**Example: 254** <br>
First division: 254/16 = Quotient 15 Remainder 14 (Hex digit E) <br>
Second division: 15/16 which is not possible so the remainder is 15 (Hex digit F) <br>
Thus if we read from bottom up is **FE**. <br>

## Hexadecimal (Base 16) to Decimal (Base 10) 
**Steps:**
1. Write down the positions numbers for each binary digit. Always remember to start counting from right most with the first starting from 0.
2. Multiply the respective binary digit with the $16^{(Position Number)}$.
3. Add up all the results together.

Example is same as binary to decimal except is 16 instead of 2.

## Binary (Base 2) to Hexadecimal (Base 16)
**Steps:**
1. Split the binary into groups of 4 bits, strating from the right (LSB). If there is 1 group with 3 only, add 0 in front to make it groups of 4.
2. Convert every group to its decimal equivalent
3. Convert from decimal to hexadecimal from left to right. No division is required. Decimal 0-9 is same as hexadecimal. Decimal 10-15 is A-F in hexadecimal. 

**Example: 0010 0100 1000**
The first group which is the left most is 2 in decimal.
The second group which is in the middle is 4 in decimal.
The last group which is the most right is 8 in decimal.
Thus is 248 in hexadecimal.

## Hexadecimal (Base 16) to Binary (Base 2)
**Steps:**
1. Split the hexadecimal digit individually.
2. Convert from Decimal to Binary.
   - Hex 0–9 → binary 0000–1001
   - Hex A–F → binary 1010–1111
4. Each group is of 4 binary bits which is 1 hexadecimal or decimal digit.
