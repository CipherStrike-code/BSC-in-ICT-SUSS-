# Introduction to Operating System
Operating systems are an integral part of our daily life, powering mobile devices such as phones and laptops to our computers and smart television. It is essenstial that we, as Infomation and Communciation Technology (ICT) Professional, know more about Operating System (OS) than what the general public knows. 

Example of Operatings are: 
1. Android

- A hardware provides the basic computing resources for the system.
- The applications are designed to define how computing resources are beign used to solve the user problem.
- The Operating system controls the hardware and coordinates its resources with the software, acting as a bridge between the software application and hardware.

An operating system is essential as it plays a huge part in liasing between the hardware and input devices such as the keystroke from the keyboard to the application software such as Microsoft word.

# Core Functions of an Operating System
An OS must fulfill 3 objectives. They are:
1. Convenience (Making a computer easier to use)
2. Efficiency (Making efficient use of the system resources)
3. Ability to evolve (Permits new systems to be introduced)
