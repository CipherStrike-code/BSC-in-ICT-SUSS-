# Introduction
This module covers the fundamental knowledge and skills that is require for the students to understand moderne operating systems. The module will cover on the core functions of the operating system that includes memory management, process management, file system management and device management. Hands-on practice are also included using virtual machines on basic system management and security via Linux System (Ubuntu). This also allows student to gain knowledge on the benefits of operating system virtualisation, as well as basic background knowledge on system administration. Students are able to learn how the hypervisor technology creates virtual machines and manage the guest operating systems running in them. Not only that, mobile operating systems will also be included as part of the module to learn about the design of them and how they are used to mange the features of mobile devices. 

# Syllabus
## 1. Introduction to Operating Systems and Virtualisation
This topic introduces the term operating system and the core functions that it should provide. An introduction regarding the core functions such as process management, file system management, security, etc will be briefly covered. In-depth detail for the core functions will be go covered in the following topics. Virtualisation technology will also be introduces and expained on how it affects the current industry and includes labs as well in using virtual machines. 

## 2. Linux Operating System and File System Management
An introduction of Linux Operating System (OS) as well as file system management will be covered in the module. Labs are also coverd in this module.

## 3. Access Control and System Security 
System security and access control, which are a critical part of a modern OS will be covered in this topic. The various types of access control methods will be covered, especially in the file system access. The different types of threats and their countermeasures in system security will also be covered.

## 4. Process and Memory Management
Process management, which is a fundamental concept in OS will be covered in this topic. Things like process states, deadlock and scheduling will be discussed. This topic also focuses on memory management, memory partitioning and paging. 

## 5. Device Management and Fault Tolerance
Device management, with focus on disk will be discussed in this topic. It also covers fault tolerance, such as RAID system. Labs will be provided using Z File System (ZFS) to implement fault tolerance. 

## 6. System Management and Mobile Operating Systems 
The topic covers system management which includes system monitoring and disk quota. This unit will touch on two popular mobile operating systems, Android OS and iOS.
