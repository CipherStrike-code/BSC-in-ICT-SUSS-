## **Discipline-Specific**
This means the writing should be grounded in a particular field. 

How do you know what the methods and conventions of your academic field are? You become exposed to these and learn them as you read academic articles, books and other written materials in your field.

The best way to learn to be a good writer is to understand how other people write. Articles and books have been published. This means they adhere to the methods and conventions of a given academic field. So, read, read, read.

When you understand the methods and conventions of writing in your field, you know what is expected of you.

When you can write like other people in your academic field, it signifies you are a member of that community.

- Shows that you are a **member** of a particular academic community. If you can write like a doctor and can convvinced people with your writing, you are a doctor. Be who you want to write like. 
  
## **Evidence-based**
This means the writing should provide proof that statements are true and supported by facts.  

This shows you have studied and researched the subject before writing and it illustrates your ability to apply what you have learnt.

The inclusion of examples and reference to other writers demonstrates your background reading in preparation for the written assignment.

This also provides a trail of evidence that is necessary to avoid accusations of plagiarism.

Providing evidence not only strengthens the claims you make, but also indicates the depth and breadth of your knowledge on a given subject. 
- Assertions should be support by **verifiable** facts, figures and other knowledge.
- Statements should be supported by **relevant**, real-world examples.
- Sources of information should be **clearly documented** (APA Citation Format)

## Balanced
This means the writing should be fair in the way ideas are supported or challenged. 

A balanced piece of writing illustrates that you are able to select the most appropriate information and use it effectively to support your assertions.

You should not disrespect those whose views you disagree with, since they may have valid points based on sound evidence. Any challenge you make should be supported by more compelling proof than that provided by others.

An open mind is essential for anyone who wishes to learn. Your ideas might change based on what you read and how you relate your knowledge to the topic of the written assignment. 
- Writing should show a **range** of background reading on an issue. There can be many ways to address and not just one way.
- Statements and assertions should be based on **logical reasoning**. The information may be clear to you but not to your reader. If your reader do not understand, it means that you have failed to convey your point.
- Be open-minded. Discuessions should present opposing views **fairly**.
- Conclusions should be drawn from **careful reflection** of the evidence.

## Truthful
This means the writing should present the writer's ideas and acknowledge the contribution of others to those ideas. 

Knowledge is extended by the most current data and thinking on a given subject. This should be used as far as possible. Out-dated information may not be valid at the time you write.

Use materials from reputable sources, such as academic publishers, research institutions and quality newspapers to provide a trail of evidence and acknowledge the originators of the ideas and information you have used.

The conclusions you draw should not contradict the evidence you have presented. You should not try to manipulate the findings and words of others to support your conclusions. 
- Statements should be based on **accurate, current** data and state of knowledge. Do not go looking for very old books or resources. A general guideline is 5 years of data.
