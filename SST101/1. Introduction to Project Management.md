# Types of Organisation:

## Functional Organisation
- Manage projects based on the functional hierarchy of the organisation
- In a project, there are multiple segments. Each segments is dedicated and assigned to respective functional units.
- Each unit is responsible to complete its portion of the project.
- A functional organisation is a vertical hierarchy.
