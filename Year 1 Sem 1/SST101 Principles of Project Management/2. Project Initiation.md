- Each unit is reponsible for completing its portion of the project.
- Example is the Singapore Armed Forces

**Advantages of Functional Organisation**
- No Change. The current work practice in organisation operations are followed
- Flexibility. Specialists in the different functional units can be assigned part-time to work on project, then return to normal job scope after completion portion of project
- In-depth Expertise. Specialists can work on their own important parts.
- Easy Post-Project Transition. Specialists can focus on both their professional growth and contribute to the project. 

**Disadvantages of Functional Organisation**
- Lack of Focus. Each of the functional unit has their own routine work and they may put their routine ops as precedence before the project work
- Poor Integration. Functional units tend to be more concerned with their assigned work as compared to the whole project scope requirements
- Lack of Speed. Slow response time to circulate project information and decisions through normal functional channels. Each functional groups may also prefer to work in solo and not be motivated to communcate out of their comfort zones.
- Lack of Ownership. Lack of motivation by team assigned to project. They may take it as additional task on top of their normal routine task.
