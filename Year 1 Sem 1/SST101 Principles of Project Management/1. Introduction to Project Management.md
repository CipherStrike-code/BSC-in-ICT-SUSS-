# Types of Organisation:
- Functional Organisation
- Projectised Organisation (Also known as dedicated Project Teams)
- Matrix Organisation

## Functional Organisation
- Manage projects based on the functional hierarchy of the organisation
- In a project, there are multiple segments. Each segments is dedicated and assigned to respective functional units.
- Each unit is responsible to complete its portion of the project.
- A functional organisation is a vertical hierarchy.
- Employees report to a manager who oversees their department.
- Managers are responsible of coordinating with other managers of other departments

</p>

## Projectised Organisation
- It is also known as dedicated project teams
- Opposite of Functional Organisation
- These project teams function as separate units from the rest of the parent organisation
- Usually, the team will consists of dedicated specialists led by full-time project manager who will work all on full time.
- Project managers have full authority over the project resources.

</p>

## Matrix Organisation
- It is a hybrid form.
- Horizontal PM structure is applied to normal functional hierarchy.
Two chains of command:
  - Command along functional lines
  - Command along project lines
- Some organisations uses temporary matrix setup to deal with certain projects, while in others, they are a permanent fixture.
- It is designed to optimally utilise resources by having individuals to work on multiple project.
- In matrix organisation, tem memebers report to theri project manager as well as their department head.

## Project Scope Checklist of Items
- Project Objective
- Deliverables
- Milestones
- Technical Requirements
- Limits and Exclusions
- Reviews with Customers

# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- It is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables.
- It is useful in helping to make complex projects easier to understand, just like how we dismantle an item to pieces.
- The WBS is designed to provide a visual framework/breakdown for project execution.

## Responsibility Matrix (Also known as RACI Matrix)
- RACI is also known as **Responsible, Accountable, Consulted and Informed**.
- Defines the agreed responsbility for all roles in achieving a particular project or task
- Clarifies roles and responsibilities, ensuring that everyone knows what to do
- Defines decision-making responsibility
- Reduce risk of misunderstanding

## Responsible
Individuals with responsibility for the task or deliverable is responsible for developing and completing the project themselves. Examples are:
1. Content Writer
2. Graphic Designer
3. UI/UX Designer

## Accountable
Ensures accountability to project deadlines and project completion. Examples of accountable parties are:
1. Project Manager
2. Deparment Lead
3. Team Lead

## Consulted
Reviews the deliverable and provide input of based on their domain of expertise. Examples are:
1. Sales Team
2. Software Architect
3. Creative Director
4. QA Manager

## Informed
Informed stakeholders are kept in the loop on the project progress. Examples are:
1. Executive Leadership
2. External Clients
3. Team members assigned to dependent tasks

## Types of Costs
1. **Project Direct Cost**
   - Expenses Directly tied to a specific project. (Examples are Labour cost, materials and subcontractors)
   - Variable, project-specific, itemised in project budgets
2. **Direct Project Overhead Cost**
   - Indirect expenses supporting a specific project (Examples are project management personnel, project office rent and software licenses)
   - Semi-variable, project-related, not task-specific
3. **General and Administrative (G&A) Costs**
  - Indirect expenses unrelated to any specific projects. (Examples are corporate salaries, office rent, insurance, legal fees, etc)
  - Fixed/Semi-fixed, Organisation-wide, not project-specific

## Estimates
We would require estimates for all the project. We shall at why is it important.
- Helps to support sound decision-making.
- Develop time-phased budgets and establish the project baseline.
- Schedule work and tasks.
- Determines project length (duration) and costs.
- Develop cash flow requirements as well as budget considerations.
- Determine if the project is worth considering and embarking on.
- Determine how well the project is progressing compared to plan.

## Risk Management
- Risk Management is a procacttive and preventive process.
- Designed to help minimise the occurrences of risk events and the consequences posed by the risk event should it happen.

</p>

## Risk Severity Matrix
- Used to determine the probability and matrix of the risk event, and how the team should assess how difficult to detect the risk occurences.

## Type of Resource Contraints
- People
  - Human resources are often categorised based on the skills they can contribute the project. In some cases, specialised skills are vital to a project's success, while in other times, more general skill sets provide flexibility and can be applied interchangeably.
- Materials
  - Projects materials that may be needed for certain part of the project activities, such as cement for construction and concrete for road.
- Equipment
  - Equipment is usually presented by type, size and quantity. This is the most often overlooked resource during project implementation especially if an organisation owns the equipment.
