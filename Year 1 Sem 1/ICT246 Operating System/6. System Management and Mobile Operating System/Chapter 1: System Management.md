## Disk Quota
Disk Quota is the amount of space that we have to store files. The amount of storage space is based on the available disk space on the ECS file servers and the type of computer account we hold. 
- Disk Quota is a common feature on the modern OS.
- It prevents an OS partition from running out of space
- It prevents a single user from using up the entire file space
- Organisations use disk quota to control the disk space granted to the users. For example, the marketing department can be granted more disk space than the sales department.
- Service provider such as web hosting companies can use disk quota to grant different levels of disk space to different clients based on the price plan.
