## Introduction to Operating System
We need to study computer system as it is used everywhere in our daily life. As a Infomation and Communication Technology (ICT) professional or student, we will need to be proficient in knowing operating system, what it is and what it does. <br>
A computer system consists of the 4 following layers of interaction:
- User
- Application
- Operating System
- Hardware

</p>

The hardware consists of the following:
- Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- Memory
- Input/Output (I/O) Devices
- Storage

The application programs are programs such as:
- Web Browsers
- Word processing software defining the computer resoures to solve the user problems.

The operating system controls the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for the user. <br>

The operating system acts as an intermediary between the hardware and the application software.

Below are a list of some of the commonly used operating system in the world:
- Windows
  - Client OS
  - Server OS
- Linux
- Unix
- Mac OS
- Mobile OS
  - Android
  - iOS

## Operating System Objectives
1. Convenience
  - An operating system as a user/computer interface.
  - To make the computer convenient to use
  - Program Development
    - Editors and Debuggers to assist program development
  - Program Execution
    - OS handles the execution of program and process, and scheduling of resources
  - Access to I/O devices
    - OS handles the hardwar and provides simple read/write for the different hardware devices
  - Controlled access to files
    - OS provides file management services as well as providing mechanism of access control to files and folders.
  - System access
    - OS resolves conflict for resources contentional as well as control access to the system
  - Error detection and response
    - OS handles varies errors conditions such as issues in executing program
  - Accounting
    - OS monitors system performance and provides statistics for the user to view. 
2. Efficiency
  - The Operating System acts as a resource manager.
  - It must be able to provide efficient and fair sharing of resources among users and programs
  - Control mechanism of how resources are allocated and used.
  - Kernel that directly manages hardware resources and implements these control mechanisms. 
3. Ability to evolve
  - It should be easy to modify and update.
  - It must adapt to changes to hardware and any new emerging technology
  - It should support new services, features, and patches without major redesign.

## Core Functions of Operating System
There are 4 main core functions of an Operating System.
- Processes
  - The execution of a program, represented by its thread of execution, current state and the resources allocated to it.
- Memory Management
  - Management of memory (Allocates, tracks, protects and optimises main memory usage)
- Information Protection and Security
  - Access control: Authentication, Authorisation, and Accounting
- Scheduling and Resource Management
  - Scheduling (Process Queuing in Memory before being executed by Processor)
  - Resource Management (Handle I/O and Allocate Resources Efficiently and Fairly)

## Types of Operating System
There are 2 types of operating system that we generally need to know.
- Uniprogramming
- Multiprogramming

### Uniprogramming
Uniprogramming means that only a single taks or program is in the memory at any particular time. This more common in initial computers. 

**Characteristic**
1. Less main memory is needed as only one program sits in main memory at any time.
2. Less efficient use of the processor during periods of I/O operations.
3. Programs are executed sequentially, one after the other.

### Multiprogramming
Multiprogramming means that multiple programs can be run at the same time. 

**Characteristic**
1. The memory can hold several programs at one time.
2. Resources are being allocated to different programs.
3. Size of the memory is larger compared to uniprogramming.
4. More efficient use of the processor. Another program can run when the current program is waiting for an I/O operation.
