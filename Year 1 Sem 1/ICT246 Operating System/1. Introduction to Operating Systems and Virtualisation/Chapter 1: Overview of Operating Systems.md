## Introduction to Operating System
We need to study computer system as it is used everywhere in our daily life. As a Infomation and Communication Technology (ICT) professional or student, we will need to be proficient in knowing operating system, what it is and what it does. <br>
A computer system consists of the 4 following layers of interaction:
- User
- Application
- Operating System
- Hardware

</p>

The hardware consists of the following:
- Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- Memory
- Input/Output (I/O) Devices
- Storage

The application programs are programs such as:
- Web Browsers
- Word processing software defining the computer resoures to solve the user problems.

The operating system controls the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for the user. <br>

The operating system acts as an intermediary between the hardware and the application software.

Below are a list of some of the commonly used operating system in the world:
- Windows
  - Client OS
  - Server OS
- Linux
- Unix
- Mac OS
- Mobile OS
  - Android
  - iOS

## Operating System Objectives
1. Convenience
  - An operating system as a user/computer interface.
  - To make the computer convenient to use
  - Program Execution
    - OS handles the execution of program and process, and scheduling of resources
  - Access to I/O devices
    - OS handles the hardwar and provides simple read/write for the different hardware devices
  - Controlled access to files
    - OS provides file management services as well as providing mechanism of access control to files and folders.
  - System access
    - OS resolves conflict for resources contentiona as well as control access to the system
  - Error detection and response
    - OS handles varies errors conditions such as issues in executing program
  - Accounting
    - OS monitors system performance and provides statistics for the user to view. 
2. Efficiency
  - The Operating System acts as a resource manager.
  - It must be able to provide efficient and fair sharing of resources among users and programs
  - Control mechanism of how resources are allocated and used.
  - Kernel that directly manages hardware resources and implements these control mechanisms. 
3. Ability to evolve
  - It should be easy to modify and update.
  - It must adapt to changes to hardware and any new emerging technology
  - It should support new servies, features, and patches without major redesign.

## Core Functions of Operating System
There are 4 main core functions of an Operating System.
- Processes
  - The execution of a program, represented by its thread of execution, current state and the resources allocated to it.
- Memory Management
  - Management of memory (Allocates, tracks, protects and optimises main memory usage)
- Information Protection and Security
  - Access control: Authentication, Authorisation, and Accounting
- Scheduling and Resource Management
  - Scheduling (Process Queuing in Memory before being executed by Processor)
  - Resource Management (Handle I/O and Allocate Resources Efficiently and Fairly)
