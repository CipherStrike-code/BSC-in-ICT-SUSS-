## Computer Capabilities
- **Processing** (Done by processor) 
  - Includes performing computations and performing "logic" functions such as comparison and branching
- **Storage** 
  - Able to store instructions and data
- **Communication** 
  - Within itself and with other devices

## Computer Processors 
There are a total of 2 types of processor. 
1. **General-Purpose Processor** (General purpose processor, Microprocessor, Von Neumann processor)
    - Reads its program insructions from a storage device (Example. Hard disk, Memory)
    - Content of the storage device changeable, thus changing the program and function performed by the processor
2. **Special-Purpose Processor** (Embedded processor, Application-Specific processor, Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), GPU)
    - Uses program storage that can't be altered
    - Has a single program "wired" into the processor
  
However, both **General-Purpose Processor** and **Special-Purpose Processor** has the same characteristics as they are both processors.
- A procesor should be able to perform the following functions:
    - Arithmetic Computation (+,-,x,÷)
    - Comparison (<, =, >, ≠, ≤, ≥)
    - Data movement and communication among memory, mass storage, and I/O devices
 - Perform instruction given by the memory
    - Memory → Processor → Execution → Output

An instruction is a command to a procesor to perform a specific function (e.g. arithmetic operation) on specific data input(s). Each instruction is relatively simple. Complex tasks are done by combining many instructions into a program and executing the program. When a processor "follows an instruction, it means that the processor is executing an instruction.
