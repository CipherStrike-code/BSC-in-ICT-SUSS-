## Computer Capabilities
- **Processing** (Done by processor) 
  - Perform computations
  - Perform logic functions such as comparison and branching
- **Storage** 
  - Able to store instructions and data
- **Communication** 
  - Within itself and with other devices

## Computer Processors 
There are a total of 2 types of processors. 
1. **General-Purpose Processor** (General purpose processor, Microprocessor, Von Neumann processor)
    - Reads its program instructions from a **storage device** (Example. Hard disk, Memory)
    - Contents of the storage device are changeable, so the program and the function performed by the processor can change.
2. **Special-Purpose Processor** (Embedded processor, Application-Specific processor, Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), GPU)
    - Uses program storage that can't be altered
    - Has a single program "wired" into the processor
  
**Note:** Both **General-Purpose Processor** and **Special-Purpose Processor** share the same characteristics as they are both processors.

## Processor Characteristics and Functions

- A processor should be able to perform the following functions:
    - Arithmetic Computation (+, -, x, ÷)
    - Comparison (<, =, >, ≠, ≤, ≥)
    - Data movement and communication among memory, mass storage, and I/O devices
 - Perform instruction given by the memory
    - Memory → Processor → Execution → Output

## Instruction 
- A command to the processor to perform a specific function (e.g., arithmetic operation) on specific data.
- Each instruction is relatively simple.
- Complex tasks are accomplished by combining many instructions into a program and executing the program.
- When a processor “follows an instruction,” it is said to be executing the instruction.
- An instruction is a command to a processor to let the processor to know to perform specific functions.

**Storage Capacity**
Computers need to be able to store:
  - **Intermediate processing results** (Also knowns as a temporary output at a certain stage of the process or workflow, which may be used for further operations or as an input for a later stage)
  - **Data** (Persistent Output from a previous program execution and can be used as input for future executions. It is different from intermediate processing result as it is not temporary and can be used in different process or workflow.)<br>

| Aspect	| Intermediate Result	| Output Data (Past Executions) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stage	| During processing	| After processing |
| Persistence	| Temporary	| Permanent/Stored |
| Purpose	| Used for next steps	| Used for future program input |
| Example	| Partial sum in calculation	| Saved report in a database |

</div>
  -  Programs

There are however several differences between storage devices and these characteristic are:
- Speed
- Volatility
- Cost per bit

## Input/Output Capability
I/O devices must be able to comprise many communication modes:
- Sound, text and graphics for human interaction
- Electronic or optical communcation for other computers interaction

## Computer Hardware
There are 4 major functions of computer hardware. They are:
- External Communication
- Storage
- Processing
- Internal Communication

## Hardware Components
4 Main Components make up a Computer System
1. CPU
2. Main Memory
3. I/O Unit
4. System Bus

| Components | Functions |
| --- | --- |
| CPU | A Processor that performs computation, comparison and data movement |
| Main Memory | It is also known as primary storage. It is used to store both data and instructions |
| I/O Unit | Performs exterenal communication functions |
| System Bus | A communication channel taht connects all the computer system. It includes the data bus, address bus, and control bus that carry data, memory addresses, and control signals respectively. The system bus acts like a communication highway within the motherboard enabling data transfer and coordination between components.|
