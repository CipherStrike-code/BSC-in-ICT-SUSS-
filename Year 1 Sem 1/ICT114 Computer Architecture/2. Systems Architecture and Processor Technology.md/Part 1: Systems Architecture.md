## Computer Capabilities
- **Processing** (Done by processor) 
  - Perform computations
  - Perform logic functions such as comparison and branching
- **Storage** 
  - Able to store instructions and data
- **Communication** 
  - Within itself and with other devices

## Computer Processors 
There are a total of 2 types of processors. 
1. **General-Purpose Processor** (General purpose processor, Microprocessor, Von Neumann processor)
    - Reads its program instructions from a **storage device** (Example. Hard disk, Memory)
    - Contents of the storage device are changeable, so the program and the function performed by the processor can change.
2. **Special-Purpose Processor** (Embedded processor, Application-Specific processor, Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), GPU)
    - Uses program storage that can't be altered
    - Has a single program "wired" into the processor
  
**Note:** Both **General-Purpose Processor** and **Special-Purpose Processor** share the same characteristics as they are both processors.

## Processor Characteristics and Functions

- A processor should be able to perform the following functions:
    - Arithmetic Computation (+, -, x, ÷)
    - Comparison (<, =, >, ≠, ≤, ≥)
    - Data movement and communication among memory, mass storage, and I/O devices
 - Perform instruction given by the memory
    - Memory → Processor → Execution → Output

## Instruction 
- A command to the processor to perform a specific function (e.g., arithmetic operation) on specific data.
- Each instruction is relatively simple.
- Complex tasks are accomplished by combining many instructions into a program and executing the program.
- When a processor “follows an instruction,” it is said to be executing the instruction.
