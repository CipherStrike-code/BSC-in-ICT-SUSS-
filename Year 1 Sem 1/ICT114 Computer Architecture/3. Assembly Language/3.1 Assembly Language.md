## User Visible Registers
- General Purpose Registers
  - Assigned to a variety of functions by the programmer
  - Can be used for data (as an accumulator) or addressing functions
- Data Registers
  - Used only to hold data
  - Cannot be employed in the calculation of an operand address
- Address Registers
  - Used to hold Address or employed in the calculation of an operand address
  - Used as a Stack Pointer
- Condition Codes Registers
  - Contains flags or bits set by the processor hardware as the result of operation
  - E.g. Result of last operation is 0

## Von Neumann Computer Architecture - Control & Status Registers
The Von Neumann Computer Architecture is widely used in general-purpose computing.
Registers that are used are:
1. Program Counter (PC)
  - Contains the address of an instruction to be fetched
  - Automatically points to the next instruction after the current instruction is fetched
2. Instruction Register (IR)
  - Contains the most recently fetched instruction
3. Memory Address Register (MAR)
  - Contains the address of a location in memory
4. Memory Buffer Register (MBR)
  - Contains a word of data to be written to memory or the word most recently read
5. Program Status Word (PSW)
  - Contains a set of bits that includes condition codes
  - Sign of last result, Zero, Carry-Over, Equal, Overflow, Interrupt, Supervisor (indicates whether processor is executing in supervisor or user mode.

## Assembly Language, Motorola MC 68000 Processor, EASy68k and M114
- An assembly language is a low-level programming language, and is machine dependent.
  - Machine Dependent means it runs on a specific computer.
  - Machine Independent means it runs on multiple different type of hardware.
  - For example, machine code for x86 architecture cannot be used for Motorola MC68000 architecture.
- Each instruction of the assembly language corresponds directly to a CPU operation.
- We will touch on assembly language programming for the Motorola MC68000 processor.
- EASy68k is the Editor/Assembler/Simulator for the Motorola MC68000 microprocessor.
- EASy68k allows us to edit, assembl and run 68000 programs on a Windows PC.

## Data Registers
- D0 to D7, Data Registers - 32-bit and can be treated as 8,16 or 32 bits.
- Instruction with a .B indicates Data Register is handling 8 bits or 1 byte.
  - I.e. bit 0 to bit 7
  - E.g. MOVE.B D0, D1
- Instruction with .W indicates Data register is handling 16 bits or 1 word
  - I.e. bit 0 to bit 15
  - E.g. MOVE.W D0, D1
- Instruction with .L indicates Data register is handling 32 bits or 1 long word
  - I.e. bit 0 to bit 31
  - E.g. MOVE.L D0, D1

## Address Registers
- A0 to A6, Address Registers – 32-bit
- A7, Stack Pointer – 32-bit
- PC, Program Counter – 32-bit
- SR, Status Register – 16-bit
  - There are 5 status flags
  - For this module, we will focus on 2 status flags
  - Z flag or Zero flag
    - Is set (Z=1) when an arithmetic or logical operation resulted in destination operand equal to zero
  - N flag or Negative flag
    - Is set (N=1) when an arithmetic or logical operation resulted in destination operand to be negative

## Motorola MC68000 Memory Organisation 
- All numbers in MC68000 assembly language are in hexadecimal
  - $ prefix denotes hexadecimal
- Address bus is 24-bit wide - can address $2^{24}$ memory locations
- Range $000 000 to $FFF FFF. A space is added after every 3 hexadecimal digits to improve readability.
- Each memory address or location holds a byte of storage.
- Can be organised as
  - 8 bit or byte
  - 16 bit or word or
  - 32 bit or long word
- Words and long words must be aligned on even address
- MC68000 uses big endian byte ordering - multi-byte data (like words and long words) is stored with the most significant byte at the lowest memory address.

## Example
If a 32-bit long word $12345678 is stored at address $001000. This is how it is stored.

</p>

- Each instruction consists of 2 parts
  - Operation Code (Op code)
  - Operand Specification
  - E.g. MOVE D0, D1 (Move D0 to D1)
- Op code: MOVE
- Operand Specification
  - Source Operand E.g. D0
  - Destination and Result Operand E.g. D1
- You are expected to know and use the M114 instruction set for TMA and the exam.

## Addressing Modes
- Data to be operated on can be specified in different ways in an instruction
  - In the data register
  - In the instruction itself
  - In memory, etc
- The way an instruction operand specifies the data is known as its addressing modes
