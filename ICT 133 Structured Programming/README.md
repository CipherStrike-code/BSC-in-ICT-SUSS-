## 1. Introduction to Programming and Python
This unit introduces the computer as a universal machine, programs systax and formal notation and desrcibes a systematic approach to the process of writing a program. Python is used for the course and programming concepts are being introduce, such as varibels and assignment statements and how they map to the hardware in a computer system. Input-Output-Processing (IPO) is also being introduce and illustrated using several examples. 

## 2. Scalar and Sequence Data Types and Files 
This unit focuses on the different data types available in python and the implications that it have on the program. It will cover both scalar (single value) and sequence (ordered collection of values) data types.
